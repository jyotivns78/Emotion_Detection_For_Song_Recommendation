# Emotion_Detection_For_Song_Recommendation

INTRODUCTION - 

* Music plays an important role in our daily life. Users have to face the task of manually browsing the music.
* This project recognizes the facial expressions of user and play songs according to emotion.
* Computer vision is a field of study which encompasses on how computer see and understand digital images and videos.
* The facial expressions are captured using a webcam and face detection is done by using Haar cascade classifier.

MOTIVATION - 

* Music has always been known to alter the mood of an individual.
* Capturing and recognizing the emotion being voiced by a person and displaying appropriate songs matching the one's mood and can increasingly calm the mind of a user and overall end up giving a pleasing effect.
* The best possible way in which people tend to analyze or conclude the emotion or the feeling or the thoughts that another person is trying to express is by facial expression.

OBJECTIVES - 

* Music listeners have a tough time creating and segregating the playlist manually when they have hundreds of songs. It is also difficult to keep track of all the songs: 
* Users have  to manually select songs every time based on interest and mood. User’s also have difficulty to reorganize and playing music when play-style varies.
* So, we have used Machine Learning concept which involves facial scanning and feature tracking to determine the user’s mood and based on it gives a personalized playlist.


METHODOLOGY - 

The facial expressions are captured using a webcam and face detection is done by using Haar cascade classifier.
